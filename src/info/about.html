Adversary Hangman is the classic hangman game with some added bells and 
whistles, which can be explored by clicking the 'Settings' button.
<h3>Dictionary</h3>
Any text file where words are separated by whitespace can be used by the 
program. Words containing non-letters and numbers are ignored. Note that 
duplicates are not culled. The default word list used is the Brown and LOB 
Corpus' 5066 most common words. If you want more varied and 
challenging sets, I recommend looking at Alan Beale's 12dicts Word Lists 
(http://www.wyrdplay.org/12dicts.html).
<h3>Word Choice</h3>
Under this category the user can change the word choice algorithm used by the 
program. <i>Random</i> should be clear enough. <i>Scrabble</i> randomly
selects 10 words from the dictionary, and chooses the one yielding the highest
base score in Scrabble. <i>Adversary</i> is the most challenging mode. It 
doesn't choose a word in the beginning at all. Instead, it constructs its
word based on your letter choices over the course of the game, aiming to 
thwart you efforts to win. This mode is inspired by the concept of adversary 
models, which are used to analyze the performance of computer algorithms.
<h3>Word Length and Lives</h3>
These should be self-explanatory. Note that depending on the dictionary, 
there may be word lengths that are invalid, but technically selectable in
the slider. If you attempt to choose an invalid length, the program will 
gently prompt you to select something else. There is also the option, 
enabled by default, of randomizing the word length after each game.
